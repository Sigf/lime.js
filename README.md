lime.js
=======

WebGL rendering framework that I am making to learn about WebGL and good project organization.

Credits:
-----
* I used some utilities libraries taken from the book "WebGL Programming Guide" by Kouichi Matsuda and Rodger Lea

* I am trying to emulate and learn from the coding style of the three.js library made by mrdoob.

Reference:
----
I hosted the compiled file here: http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~shutt/lime1_1.js
It can easily be referenced on a webpage using that link.
